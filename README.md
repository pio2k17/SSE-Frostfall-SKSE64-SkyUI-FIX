# SSE-Frostfall-SKSE64-SkyUI-FIX
Temporary fix for Skyrim SSE (64bit) running Campire, Frostfall, SKSE64, and SkyUI. Fixes for 16:9 and 21:9 ultrawide.
Based off authors temporary fix outlined here: http://www.dracotorre.com/blog/frostfall-se-skse64/

First install: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048/?

Then install this fix, install only one file using NMM. 16:9 users install the normal fix, 21:9 ultrawide users use the
ultrawide fix. 

Then after starting up Skyrim SSE SKSE564 go into MOD SETTINGS -> SkyUI and turn off version checking for these 4 menus: 
inventory, barter, container, and crafting. Otherwise you will see warning popups when you initially use them.

Instructions here for disabling those version checks and setting up your Frostfall meters to sit compactly at the top 
right of your screen:
